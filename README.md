- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sora7672
- 👀 I’m interested in all too many things, but sometimes League of Legends is an enjoyable experience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning also many things. Far too many things some may say.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on overturning the hierarchy established by the gods in days long before the life of you, me, or this universe.
- 📫 How to reach me: Contact me via email at sw.sora7672@gmail.com or via phone(preferable text) at (919) 297-8558.

I'm currently working professionally as a web developer and have been working primarily with WordPress and develoing plugins for WordPress, but I am also experienced with
C#, C++, HTML, Java, Javascript, CSS, and C. Additionally, I am on an academic journey to becoming an electrical/computer engineer and have thus far obtained my Associates,
so I also know math and science pretty well.
